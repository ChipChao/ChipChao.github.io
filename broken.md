# WEBSITE LOOKS BROKEN?

Here are some possible reasons:

# 1: SITE THEME WAS CHANGED.

No, we do not mean Changed, the game we hate, but we mean that ***We changed the site theme and text formatting broke because of it.*** If this happens, wait for us to fix the formatting so it'll look normal. This should ***not*** happen because this website is made in Markdown (instead of something like JavaScript, HTML or Python) and text formatting on pages should update imediately or sooner than later.

## 1: SOLUTION?

Wait. The text formatting should 99% of the time immediately update after the site theme has been changed. If it doesn't, wait some more. If it still doesn't then create an issue on GitHub and mention one of the band members. We'll get to you.

# 2: WEB CONTENTS AREN'T LOADING.

It's possible that a page broke because it was from a period pre-TBA (The Bono Album) announcement or was at that period (we are in the pre-TBA announcement ATM) and wasn't updated after that period or an image or video was deleted off the repo (which is how this website works with GitHub Pages) and can't access them.

## 2: SOLUTION (A)?

Solution A is when web content is deleted off the repo. In that case, it could be temporary and the page should update after that. If it doesn't, then it was likely permanent. If you think it is temporary, then wait. If however, you think it is permanent, then also make an issue on GitHub. If it is permanent, then it was likely intentionally deleted rather than an accident.

## 2: SOLUTION (B)?

Solution B is when web content is not loading but is still in the images folder in the repo. In this case, simply reload the page.


# 3: CAN I ADD SOMETHING?

Please ask. It may be yes or no.

## HOW?

You can use the Discussions tab on GitHub in this repository if you want to add something. If the answer is yes, then go for it, but please link the changed files before they are uploaded to the *main* branch in case of vandals.
