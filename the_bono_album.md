## THEORETICAL QUESTIONS

### what the fuck?

Don't worry, we're kind-of on the same page here. We haven't done much work yet, we're mainly preparing in the pre-production phase. We have all the shit ready but we're in the songwriting phase. It's getting done quickly so we can get to work on the music.

### what the fuck is the thing on the announcement image?

Well, does it look familar to you? If so, then think about what it looks like. Mainly the shape but thinking about the colour might help? Or do you have a latex fetish? But you probably aren't that disgusting. Right? If you do have a latex fetish, rethinking your life and changing would be the best choice. Wait, did we just give out the answer to what the fuck is the thing on the announcement image? FUCK.
